## 1. File Header

The header consists of four elements, in fixed order, each on its own line(s):

```
*P <customer name>
<major> <minor> [<NRM>]
<x0>,<y0>,<x1>,<y1>[,<grid>];
*R <root sheet name>
```

**`*P <customer name>`**  
optional free-text customer/documentation field.  
Parsed verbatim as the remainder of the line after `*P `.

**Version line — `<major> <minor> [<NRM>]`** — space-separated.

- `<major>` / `<minor>`: integer version number.  
  KIUC has been tested and
  confirmed working against files ranging from V1.50 through V5.72.  
  KIUC branches on the major version: `is_less_than_v500 = (major < 5)`,  
  since arc encoding differs between pre-V5.00 files and V5.00+ files.
- `<NRM>` (optional 3rd token): 8-digit string, stored as-is,  
  default  `'00000000'` if absent. KIUC does not interpret this value  
  it is carried only for round-tripping/diagnostics and is not written to `.kicad_sch`.

**Bounds line — `<x0>,<y0>,<x1>,<y1>[,<grid>];`**
- Comma-separated, terminated with `;`.
- `<x0>,<y0>`: lower-left corner of the sheet, in Ulticap units
  (1 unit = 2 mil).
- `<x1>,<y1>`: upper-right corner of the sheet.
- 5th field (optional): grid spacing. Extensive testing confirms this
  field is the sheet grid value.
- Default sheet bounds if absent (KIUC fallback, not an Ulticap-format default):  
  `xmin=-3025, ymin=-2175, xmax=3021, ymax=2159`.

**`*R <root sheet name>`**  
root/project sheet name for hierarchical designs.  
Stored verbatim as the remainder of the line after `*R `.

**End of header:**  
any line not matching `*P`, the version line, the bounds line,  
or `*R` terminates header parsing and begins the body.

## 2. Shape and Component records

### Shape definition — `*S<symbol name>`

```
*S<symbol name>
<width> <height>
1,<colour>,<x>,<y>,...,<x>,<y>,1,<colour>,<x>,<y>,...,<x>,<y>;
<pin_format>,<pin_rotation>,<rel_x>,<rel_y>,
<pin_format>,<pin_rotation>,<rel_x>,<rel_y>;
<cx>,<cy>,<r>,<rotate>,<angle>,<colour>,<thick>,0,
<cx>,<cy>,<r>,<rotate>,<angle>,<colour>,<thick>,0;
<dx> <dy> <dx_poe> <dy_poe> <size> <colour> <visibility> <tag>=<value>
;
```

(Pins, Circles/Arcs, and Attribute lines each repeat one entry per line;  
the layout above shows two example lines per section purely to  
illustrate the repeating, comma- or line-terminated pattern — see the  
per-section description below for the exact repetition and termination
rule.)

Four sections follow the width/height line, in fixed order:

1. **Outline** — comma-separated stream, terminated by `;`. Contains one or more colour-groups;  
   each group begins with the literal `1` followed by `<colour>`,  
   then an arbitrary number of `x,y` coordinate pairs forming a connected polyline.  
   The stream may span multiple physical lines; only the trailing `;` ends the section.  
   Confirmed by direct testing:  
   Ulticap silently coerces a coordinate value of `1` to `0` when saving  
   (e.g. a rectangle placed at 1,1 / 1,0 / 0,1 is rewritten with those coordinates as 0),  
   so genuine outline coordinate values of `1` should not occur in practice.  
   KIUC nonetheless retains positional sentinel detection (rather than value-based)  
   as a robust additional safeguard.

2. **Pins** — one pin per line, comma-separated, each line ending `,\n`  
   except the last, which ends `;\n`. Each line has the form  
   `<pin_format>,<pin_rotation>,<rel_x>,<rel_y>`:
   - `pin_format`:  
     `{0:none, 1:INVERTED, 2:CLOCK, 3:IEC IN, 4:IEC OUT,`  
     `5:IEC INVERTED IN, 6:IEC INVERTED OUT, 7:IEC INVERTED CLOCK,`  
     `8:IEC BIDIRECTIONAL, 9:BUS, 10:CLOCK INVERTED}`
   - `pin_rotation`:  
     `{0:East(right), 1:North(up), 2:West(left), 3:South(down)}`
   - `rel_x, rel_y`: stub-end position relative to the symbol's bottom-left origin.

3. **Circles/Arcs** — one entry per line, comma-separated, each line  
   ending `,\n` except the last, which ends `;\n`. Each line has the form  
   `<cx>,<cy>,<r>,<rotate>,<angle>,<colour>,<thick>,0`:
   - `cx, cy`: centre point.
   - `r`: radius, in Ulticap units.
   - `rotate`: degrees = value/64, counter-clockwise, 0 = east.
   - `angle`: segment sweep, degrees = value/64,  
   counter-clockwise from `rotate` (23040 = full circle).
   - `thick`: line thickness in mil.

4. **Attribute lines** — one per line, space-separated, terminated by a lone `;`.  
   Each line has the form  
   `<dx> <dy> <dx_poe> <dy_poe> <size> <colour> <visibility> <tag>=<value>`.  
   Each field is parsed independently as an integer  
   (`dx,dy,dx_poe,dy_poe,size,colour,visibility`),  
   then the remainder split on the first `=` into `<tag>` and `<value>`  
   (with overline markup `^..^` converted).  
   This attribute-line grammar is universal — the same format is reused  
   for `*C` and `*A` records. `dx_poe, dy_poe` define this attribute's  
   point-of-effect (POE) — the coordinate used to match the attribute  
   against the geometry it describes (e.g. a wire, or a symbol pin's  
   connection point); see the worked description under "PINTYPE, #,  
   LABEL / WIRELABEL" below for how POE matching is applied.

   Within a symbol's attribute block, KIUC gives special handling to:
   - `TRANSX` / `TRANSY`
     silently discarded as redundant editor artefacts.
   - `SIGNAL=<net>,<pin#>[,<pin#>...]`
      Parsed separately into a signal-pins list.  
      Not treated as a display attribute.
   - `PINTYPE`, `#` (pin number), `LABEL` / `WIRELABEL`  
      grouped by shared `(dx_poe, dy_poe)` coordinates  
      matched against each symbol pin's wire-connection point  
      (the stub endpoint on the bounding-box edge,  
      derived from `pin_rotation` and `rel_x/rel_y`).  
      Exact coordinate match is tried first.  
      If no pin's connection point coincides exactly with a POE group  
      (non-conforming/manually-edited symbols),  
      KIUC falls back to nearest-distance matching and logs a diagnostic.
   - `WIRELABEL` is used as the pin name only when `LABEL` is absent  
     (typically on PWR pins).

   The symbol's reference origin (0,0) is its bottom-left corner.

### Component placement — `*C`

```
*C <X abs> <Y abs> <rotation> <symbol name>
<dx> <dy> <dx_poe> <dy_poe> <size> <colour> <visibility> <tag>=<value>
...
;
```

- `<X abs> <Y abs>`
  absolute placement of the symbol's origin on the sheet.
- `<rotation>`: 0–7  
  see rotation/mirror table, Section 10.2.
- `<symbol name>`: references a `*S` definition appearing earlier in the file.
- Following attribute lines use the same grammar as symbol attributes  
  (space-separated, `<tag>=<value>` trailing). KIUC reads these into a  
  per-component attribute map, with direct fields extracted for  
  `REFDES`, `DEVICE`, `VALUE`, `PKG_TYPE`, `WIRELABEL`, and `FILE` (subsheet reference).
  - Placeholder values (`-`, `?`, `*`, `--`, `N/A`, empty) are normalized to "absent"  
    rather than treated as literal text.
  - `FILE=` (hierarchical subsheet reference): if absent on the `*C` instance,  
    KIUC falls back to the `FILE=` attribute on the referenced `*S` symbol definition.  
    If the resolved filename has no extension, `.SCH` is appended automatically.
- Each component pin's absolute point-of-effect is  
  `Xpoe = X_abs + dx_poe`, `Ypoe = Y_abs + dy_poe`, using the `dx_poe/dy_poe`  
  values from the matching `*S` pin's POE attribute group.
- The pin-number tag is the literal `#` character (e.g. `# = 12`).

## 3. Wire records

Two distinct wire record formats exist:  
`*LV` (free/all-angle lines)  
`*LT` (axis-constrained horizontal/vertical/diagonal lines).

### `*LV` — all-angle line

```
*LV <level> <startx> <starty> <endx> <endy> <l1> <l2> <l3>
```

Single-line record; no continuation, no terminating `;`.

- `<level>`: `1` = netlist layer, `2` = user layer.  
  Any other value is unrecognised.
- `<startx> <starty> <endx> <endy>`  
  absolute start/end coordinates.
- Netlist layer (`level=1`):
  - `<l1>` = net number (The same net number can appear across  
     multiple `*LV 1` records belonging to the same electrical net).
  - `<l2>` = `{0:wire, 1:bus}`.
- User layer (`level=2`):
  - `<l1>` = linetype + colour, packed:  
    high byte (`& 0xFF00`) = `{0:solid, 256:dashed, 512:dash-dot, 768:dot}`  
    low byte (`% 16`) = colour index (see colour palette, Section 10.7).
  - `<l2>` = line thickness, in units of 10 mil
    (i.e. on-disk value × 10 = thickness in mils).
- `<l3>` (always 0) is present in the record - unused by KIUC.

### `*LT` — axis-constrained line

```
*LT <level> <start0>
<start1> <end1> <l1> <l2> <l3>;
```

(One or more `<start1> <end1> <l1> <l2> <l3>` data lines follow the header line;  
the layout above shows a single line purely for brevity, see below for the exact repetition rule.)

The header line gives a fixed/anchor coordinate (`start0`); one or more  
data lines follow, each describing one segment sharing that anchor.  
Only the final data line is terminated with `;`.

- `<level>`: `0` or `1` = netlist layer, `2` = user layer.
- `<start1> <end1>`: start/end of the varying coordinate  
  (interpretation depends on `<l3>`, below).
- `<l3>` — orientation, and the resulting absolute endpoints:  
   (empirically determined)
  - `4` (horizontal): `y` fixed at `start0`; `x` runs `start1 → end1`.  
    Endpoints: `(start1, start0) → (end1, start0)`.
  - `5` (vertical): `x` fixed at `start0`; `y` runs `start1 → end1`.  
    Endpoints: `(start0, start1) → (start0, end1)`.
  - `6` (diagonal, NE/SW): endpoints computed as  
    `x1=(start0+start1)//2, y1=(start1-start0)//2`  
    `x2=(start0+end1)//2, y2=(end1-start0)//2`.  
    (`//` is integer floor division, not an average.)
  - `7` (diagonal, SE/NW): endpoints computed as  
    `x1=(start0+start1)//2, y1=(start0-start1)//2`  
    `x2=(start0+end1)//2, y2=(start0-end1)//2`.  
    (`//` is integer floor division, not an average.)
- Netlist layer (`level=0` or `1`):
  - `<l1>` = net number.
  - `<l2>` = `{0:wire, 1:bus}`.
- User layer (`level=2`):
  - `<l1>` = linetype + colour, same packing as `*LV` level 2  
    (high byte linetype, low byte colour).
  - `<l2>` = width: `{0:5 mil, 1:20 mil}`.

## 4. Junction records — `*V`

```
*V <X common>
<Y> <net_number> <junction_type> <type>;
```

(One or more `<Y> <net_number> <junction_type> <type>` groups follow the header line;  
the layout above shows a single group purely for brevity — see below for the exact repetition rule.)

- `<X common>`: X coordinate shared by every junction in the group.
- Each data entry is a 4-value group  
  `<Y> <net_number> <junction_type> <type>`  
  whitespace-separated (newline or space)  
  Multiple groups may appear per line or across lines.  
  Only the final group is terminated with `;`.
- `<junction_type>`: `0` = wire-to-wire (or bus-to-bus) junction  
  any other value = wire-to-bus connection (bus entry).  
  **Caveat:** files saved by Ulticap for Windows (V5.71) always  
  write `<junction_type> = 0`, regardless of the actual connection kind.  
  This means `<junction_type>` alone cannot reliably distinguish  
  wire-wire / wire-bus / bus-bus junctions on such files.  
  KIUC's net/bus construction relies on geometric matching  
  (coincident endpoints/coordinates) rather than trusting this field outright.
- `<net_number>` and `<type>` are present and correctly parsed by KIUC  
  but not currently used for net construction.  
  Nets are built from geometric matching instead.

## 5. Annotation records — `*A`

```
*A <X abs> <Y abs> <X POE abs> <Y POE abs> <size> <colour> <visibility> <tag>=<value>
```

Single-line record, no trailing `;`.

- `<X abs> <Y abs>`: absolute anchor position of the annotation text.
- `<X POE abs> <Y POE abs>`: absolute point-of-effect.  
  This is the only way KIUC determines which object an annotation belongs to:  
  KIUC checks whether `(X POE, Y POE)` lies on a wire segment,  
  or coincides with a known bus-entry point,  
  to associate a `LABEL`-tagged annotation with the wire/net or bus entry it labels.
- `<size>`, `<colour>`, `<visibility>`
  as in the universal attribute-line grammar (Section 2).
- `<tag>=<value>`: trailing text, split on the first `=`.  
  If no `=` is present, the entire trailing text is treated as the value of an  
  implicit `LABEL` tag (overline markup converted).

## 6. Free-text label records — `*X`

```
*X <x> <y> <size> <colour> <rotation> <align> <text>
```

Single-line record, no trailing `;`. `<text>` is the remainder of the  
line (may itself contain spaces) and has overline markup `^..^` converted.

- `<rotation>`: 1/64-degree units.
  Only `0` (horizontal) and `5760` (vertical, 90°) are valid.  
  Any other on-disk value is clamped to `0`.
- `<align>`: anchor position, `0`–`8`:  
  `{0:Bottom-Left, 1:Bottom-Centre, 2:Bottom-Right,`  
  `3:Centre-Left, 4:Centre-Centre, 5:Centre-Right,`  
  `6:Top-Left, 7:Top-Centre, 8:Top-Right}`.  
   Out-of-range values are clamped into `0`–`8`.  
  `*X` labels are always visible  
  (no separate visibility byte, unlike the `*A`/attribute-line grammar).

## 7. Bus records

There is no dedicated bus record type. A bus is simply a wire record  
(`*LV` or `*LT`, Section 3) with its wire/bus flag set to bus  
(`<l2> = 1` for the netlist layer). Bus entries (a wire connecting into  
a bus) are represented via `*V` junction records (Section 4) with  
`<junction_type> != 0`.

**Geometric recovery caveat:** because Ulticap for Windows (V5.71) always  
writes `<junction_type> = 0` regardless of actual connection kind (see  
Section 4), KIUC cannot rely on `<junction_type>` alone to detect bus  
entries on such files. KIUC performs a geometric recovery pass after  
parsing: for every junction not already flagged as a bus entry, if its  
coordinates land exactly on a bus-flagged wire segment, it is reclassified  
as a bus entry. This recovery is applied unconditionally (regardless of  
file version), since in valid Ulticap data a wire-junction point that  
geometrically coincides with a bus segment is, in practice, always a  
genuine wire-to-bus connection — there is no Ulticap construct for an  
ordinary wire/wire junction that happens to sit exactly on a bus by  
coincidence.

## 8. Sheet hierarchy and end-of-schematic marker

**Hierarchical subsheet references** are not a distinct record type.  
They are encoded through the ordinary `*C`/`*S` attribute grammar  
(Section 2), using a `FILE=<filename>` attribute to point to the SCH  
file implementing the subsheet. Two encoding styles exist depending on  
Ulticap version:

- **V4.x style:** the symbol (`*S`, e.g. named `HIERARCH_n` in observed files)  
  carries a placeholder `FILE=?` attribute; the real filename is supplied as an  
  override on the `*C` instance attribute block.
- **V5.x style:** the symbol (e.g. `SHEETBUS_n`) has no `FILE=` of its  
  own; the `*C` instance attribute block carries `FILE=` directly.

A `*C` is a hierarchical subsheet placement whenever its resolved  
`FILE=` value (instance override, falling back to the symbol definition  
per Section 2) is present. If the resolved filename has no extension,  
`.SCH` is appended.

**Module port symbols** (the in-sheet connector that exposes a net to  
the parent sheet at a subsheet boundary) are likewise identified  
through ordinary symbol attributes, again with two encoding styles:

- **V4.x style:** the `*S` symbol's attribute block has a `PORT=` attribute (e.g. `PORT=OUT`).
- **V5.x style:** the `*S` symbol's attribute block has a `DEVICE=` attribute  
  whose value starts with `PORT_` (e.g. `DEVICE=PORT_IN`),  
  and the symbol name itself starts with `PORT_`.

**End-of-schematic marker — `**`** — a line containing exactly `**`  
terminates the schematic body. Parsing of sheet content (`*S`, `*C`,  
`*LV`, `*LT`, `*V`, `*A`, `*X`, `*R`) stops at this point. Any content  
after `**` belongs to the extended/NRM section (Section 9) and is  
governed by entirely different rules.

## 9. Extended section — `*M` (NRM data)

Content following the `**` end-of-schematic marker, beginning with  
`*M` records, is NRM (Netlist Representation Model) data appended by a  
separate tool. KIUC does not parse, interpret, or modify this data in  
any way — it is treated as opaque and discarded entirely on read.

## 10. Definitions

### 10.1 Unit system

All coordinates in the SCH format are integers in **Ulticap units**:  
1 unit = 2 mil = 0.0508 mm. KIUC performs all geometry handling in  
integer Ulticap-unit space and only converts to mm at the point of  
KiCad output, to avoid floating-point rounding error accumulating  
through the pipeline.

The Y-axis convention is positive-Y-up, in both ASCII and binary  
Ulticap formats.

### 10.2 Rotation / mirror code (`R`, 0–7)

Used for component rotation (`*C <rotation>`) and wherever a rotation  
code appears elsewhere in attribute-derived geometry:

| R | Angle | Mirror | R | Angle | Mirror |
|---|-------|--------|---|-------|--------|
| 0 | 0°    | no     | 4 | 0°    | yes    |
| 1 | 90°   | no     | 5 | 90°   | yes    |
| 2 | 180°  | no     | 6 | 180°  | yes    |
| 3 | 270°  | no     | 7 | 270°  | yes    |


### 10.3 Overline markup

Free text fields (annotation/label text, attribute values) may contain  
Ulticap's overline syntax: a `^` starts an overline run, a second `^`  
ends it; if no closing `^` is found, the overline continues to the end  
of the text. KIUC converts this to KiCad's `~{...}` overline syntax.  
Example: `^RESET^` → `~{RESET}`; `A^B` (no closing `^`) → `A~{B}`.

### 10.4 Reference and value text alignment translation

This section covers how the visibility byte and rotation/mirror code  
on a component's REFDES/VALUE text combine to determine the text's  
on-screen anchor, and how that anchor must be pre-compensated when  
written to `.kicad_sch` so that KiCad's own automatic property-text  
flip reproduces the original Ulticap-intended display.

**Definitions**
- `V` (visibility byte): raw byte stored in the SCH file.  
  The low 5 bits give the raw anchor code: `A = V & 31`  
  (see anchor code description below).  
  For the REFDES/VALUE pairing specifically,  
  the high bits of `V` control which of the two TAGs is shown:  
  `{0:both hidden, 64:REFDES visible, 128:VALUE visible, 192:both visible}`.  
  (Note: this two-bit tag/value scheme is specific to the REFDES/VALUE pair  
  elsewhere in the format, a standalone attribute line's `<visibility>`  
  field uses only bit 128 as a single visible/hidden flag, see Section 2.)
- `A` (raw anchor code): position in a 3×3 grid.  
  `0`–`8` = horizontal text.  
  `16`–`24` = vertical text.   
  Grid:
  row `0`=Bottom, `1`=Centre, `2`=Top.  
  column `0`=Left, `1`=Centre, `2`=Right.  
  3-letter code: `[H|V][B|C|T][L|C|R]`  
  H/V = orientation (horizontal, or vertical/90° CCW)  
  B/C/T = anchor row.  
  L/C/R = anchor column.  
  Full enumeration:  
  `{0:HBL, 1:HBC, 2:HBR, 3:HCL, 4:HCC, 5:HCR, 6:HTL, 7:HTC, 8:HTR,`  
  `16:VBL, 17:VBC, 18:VBR, 19:VCL, 20:VCC, 21:VCR, 22:VTL, 23:VTC, 24:VTR}`.

**Pipeline:** the raw anchor `A` passes through three stages before  
becoming what's actually written to `.kicad_sch`:

1. **The intended display anchor** (`ulticap_translate(R, V)`) — what  
   Ulticap means to display, derived by applying the component's  
   rotation/mirror code (`R`, Section 10.2) to the raw anchor grid  
   position:

   | R | Transform on (row, col) |
   |---|--------------------------|
   | 0, 1 | identity |
   | 2, 3 | `row = 2−row, col = 2−col` (180° flip) |
   | 4, 7 | `col = 2−col` (L↔R mirror) |
   | 5, 6 | `row = 2−row` (T↔B mirror) |

2. **The value written to `.kicad_sch`** — the pre-compensated value  
   that cancels KiCad's own automatic flip of component-property text.  
   Since every flip below is self-inverse, this stage is simply stage 1  
   passed through the same KiCad-flip table again. KiCad's automatic  
   flip, by rotation code `R` (empirically verified, 144 combinations  
   tested):

   | R | H-text flip | V-text flip |
   |---|-------------|-------------|
   | 0 | none | none |
   | 1 | none | 180° (B↔T and L↔R) |
   | 2 | 180° | 180° |
   | 3 | 180° | none |
   | 4 | L↔R | T↔B |
   | 5 | T↔B | T↔B |
   | 6 | T↔B | L↔R |
   | 7 | L↔R | L↔R |

3. **What KiCad actually renders** — applying KiCad's automatic flip to  
   stage 2 always reproduces stage 1 exactly (because the flip is  
   self-inverse), so what's displayed in KiCad always matches Ulticap's  
   original intent, regardless of rotation.

**Worked example:**  
  a component at rotation `R=4` (0°, mirrored), with a raw anchor  
  `A=0` (`HBL`, horizontal bottom-left):
1. Stage 1: `R=4` applies the L↔R mirror rule (`col = 2−col`) to `HBL` → `HBR`.  
   This is what Ulticap intends to display.
2. Stage 2: apply the same `R=4` KiCad-flip table to `HBR`  
   H-text flip for `R=4` is L↔R, so `HBR` → `HBL`.  
   `HBL` is what gets written to `.kicad_sch`.
3. Stage 3: KiCad renders `HBL` with its own automatic  
   `R=4` flip applied (L↔R again) → `HBR`, matching stage 1.

The full enumeration (every `H{r}.{a}` / `V{r}.{a}` combination worked  
through all three stages) is not reproduced here, since it is fully  
reconstructible from the two tables and worked example above; there is  
no need to maintain a third, larger, harder-to-keep-in-sync artifact.

### 10.5 PINTYPE values

Used as the value of a `PINTYPE=` attribute (Section 2) on a symbol pin:

`{PAS:passive, IN:input, OUT:output, OC:open collector, OE:open emitter,`  
` BI:bi-directional, TRI:tri-state, PWR:power, NC:no connection}`

### 10.6 Reserved tag list

The following tag names (used as `<tag>` in the universal attribute-line  
grammar, Section 2) have a defined meaning to Ulticap, as documented in  
the Ulticap user manual. This list is included primarily as a reference  
for identifying unknown tags encountered in SCH files. Any tag not listed  
here is a user-defined `<KEYWORD>=<value>` pair.

| Tag | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `#` | pin#[,pin#...] | Physical part pin number(s) represented by symbol pins |
| `DESCR` | description | Brief description of the device function |
| `DEVICE` | part type name | Unique device type name for a symbol; non-homogeneous gates suffixed `/n` (e.g. `7423/1`) |
| `FILE` | filename | Hierarchical subsheet schematic filename (e.g. `FILE=MySchem3.SCH`) |
| `GATE1` | gate suffix | Starting REFDES gate suffix for non-homogeneous parts (e.g. `GATE1=C`) |
| `LABEL` | name(s) | Net name, symbolic pin name, bus name, or symbol name |
| `PARTS` | gate count | Number of gates of this type in the physical part (default 1) |
| `PINTYPE` | see 10.5 | Pin function; may be followed by `#`/`LABEL` lines as a multi-line block until the next `PINTYPE` |
| `PKG_TYPE` | PCB shape name | Preassigned PCB layout shape name |
| `PORT` | IN/OUT/BI/PAS | Used in place of `PINTYPE` on module port pins (subsheet boundary) |
| `POWER` | min,typ,max | Power dissipation in mW, for netlist/post-processing |
| `REFDES` | reference designator | Reference designator or template (`?` enables auto-annotation) |
| `SIGNAL` | net,pin#[,pin#...] | Net(s) assigned to symbol pins, including pins not visible on the symbol (e.g. power/ground) |
| `SPICE...` | — | SPICE simulation metadata |
| `TEXT` | free text | Placed free text |
| `UT_NETNAME` | name | Bus name |
| `UT_SHEETNETNAME` | name | Subsheet net/bus name |
| `VALUE` | electrical value | Component value (e.g. `VALUE=10K`) |
| `WIDTH` | trace width (mil) | Net trace width (e.g. `WIDTH=25`) |
| `WIRELABEL` | net name | Forces the wire attached to the identified pin to take this net name |

### 10.7 Colour palette (0–15)

The 16-entry Ulticap colour palette, screen-measured from DOS Ulticap  
CRT/EGA output (the EGA half-intensity level is 170/0xAA, not the  
theoretical 128). A colour field's effective palette index is always  
`colour & 0x0F`, which strips any flag bits Ulticap packs into higher  
bits of the same field (e.g. the linetype bits in `*LV`/`*LT` level-2  
records, Section 3).
